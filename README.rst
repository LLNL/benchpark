Overview
--------
You can find detailed documentation at `software.llnl.gov/benchpark
<https://software.llnl.gov/benchpark>`_. Benchpark can also be found on `GitHub
<https://github.com/llnl/benchpark>`_.

Benchpark is an open collaborative repository for reproducible specifications of HPC benchmarks.
Benchpark enables cross-site collaboration on benchmarking by providing a mechanism for sharing
reproducible, working specifications for the following:

1. **System Specifications** (benchmark and experiment agnostic)

* Hardware information
* System software environment information (available compilers, MPI)
* Scheduler and launcher

2. **Benchmark Specifications** (system and experiment agnostic)

* Source repo and version
* Build configuration (with `Spack <https://github.com/spack/spack>`_)
* Run configuration (with `Ramble <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ramble>`_)

3. **Experiment Specifications** (specific benchmark experiment on a system specification)

* Programming model (e.g., OpenMP, CUDA, ROCm) for the benchmark on a given system
* Parameters for individual runs in a study

Dependencies
------------
Benchpark uses the following open source projects for specifying configurations:

* `Spack <https://github.com/spack/spack>`_ for building benchmark and dependencies
* `Ramble <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ramble>`_ for run configurations

Community
---------
Benchpark is an open source project.  Questions, discussion,and contributions of
new specifications as well as updates and improvements to existing specifications are welcome.

* `Adding a System Specification <https://software.llnl.gov/benchpark/add-a-system-config.html>`_
* `Adding a Benchmark Specification <https://software.llnl.gov/benchpark/add-a-benchmark.html>`_
* `Adding an Experiment Specification <https://software.llnl.gov/benchpark/add-an-experiment.html>`_

We use `github discussions <https://github.com/llnl/benchpark/discussions>`_ for Q&A and discussion.
