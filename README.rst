Overview
--------
You can find detailed documentation at `software.llnl.gov/benchpark
<https://software.llnl.gov/benchpark>`_. Benchpark can also be found on `GitHub
<https://github.com/llnl/benchpark>`_.

Benchpark is an open collaborative repository for reproducible specifications of HPC benchmarks.
Benchpark enables cross-site collaboration on benchmarking by providing a mechanism for sharing
reproducible, working specifications for the following:

1. **System specifications** (benchmark and experiment agnostic)

* Hardware information
* System software environment information (available compilers, MPI)
* Scheduler and launcher

2. **Benchmark specifications** (system and experiment agnostic)

* Source repo and version
* Build configuration (with Spack)
* Run configuration (with Ramble)

3. **Experiment specifications** (specific benchmark on a specific system)

* Programming model (e.g., OpenMP, CUDA, ROCm) for the benchmark on a given system
* Parameters for individual runs in a study

Dependencies
------------
Benchpark uses the following open source packages for specifying configurations:

* `Spack <https://github.com/spack/spack>`_ to specify build configurations
* `Ramble <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ramble>`_ to specify run configurations

Community
---------
Benchpark is an open source project.  Questions, discussion, and contributions of new
