Benchpark is an open collaborative repository for reproducible specifications of HPC benchmarks.
Benchpark enables cross-site collaboration on benchmarking by providing a mechanism for sharing
reproducible, working specifications for the following:

1. **System specifications**

- location of system compilers and system MPI
- system scheduler and launcher

2. **Benchmark specifications**

- source repo and version
- build (Spack) configuration
- run (Ramble) configuration

3. **Experiment specifications**

- programming models to use for benchmarks on a given system type
- valid experiments for benchmarks on a given system (scientific parameter studies, performance parameter studies, etc.)

Dependencies
------------
Benchpark uses the following open source projects for specifying configurations:

* `Ramble <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ramble>`_ to specify run configurations
* `Spack <https://github.com/spack/spack>`_ to specify build configurations

Community
---------
Benchpark is an open source project.  Questions, discussion, and contributions
of new benchmarks, experiments, and system specifications are welcome.
We use `github discussions <https://github.com/llnl/benchpark/discussions>`_ for Q&A and discussion.

Contributing
------------
To contribute to Benchpark, please open a `pull request
<https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`_
to the `develop` branch.  Your PR must pass Benchpark's unit tests, and must be `PEP 8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_ compliant.
