# The TODO here is to figure out how we want to iterate over all of the experiments
# (which really just means we find every directory under experiments that has a ramble.yaml in it).

#That will give us the list of handles that a system config will define

#We can then add arguments that let us specify which experiments we care about when setting up a system, so we donâ€™t have to do all of them
