==============================
Getting Started with Benchpark
==============================

Git is needed to clone Benchpark, and Python 3.8+ is needed to run Benchpark::

    git clone git@github.com:LLNL/benchpark.git
    cd benchpark

Once Benchpark is available on your system, its python dependencies can be
installed using the ``requirements.txt`` file included in the root directory of
Benchpark.

To install this, you can use::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you are ready to look at the benchmarks and systems available in Benchpark,
as described in :doc:`2-benchpark-list`.
