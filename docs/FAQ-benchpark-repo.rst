=================================
Benchmark not yet in Spack/Ramble
=================================
By default, Benchpark will use ${Benchmark1} specifications (``package.py`` and ``application.py``)
provided in the Spack and Ramble repos.
It is possible to overwrite the benchmark specifications provided in the Spack and Ramble repos.
To do so, add ``package.py`` and/or ``application.py`` for ${Benchmark1} in
``benchpark/repo/${Benchmark1}``::

  benchpark
  └── repo
     ├── ${Benchmark1}
     │  ├── application.py
     │  └── package.py
     └── repo.yaml

``benchpark/repo`` can be used as a staging area for the build and run specification for
${Benchmark1} so that you can test them together with your experiment specification
on a given system.  Once the experiment is working and merged into the develop branch of Benchpark,
we would like to encourage the contributors to upstream the ``package.py`` to Spack,
and the ``application.py`` to Ramble.  When those PRs are approved and merged,
please submit a PR to remove the duplicated specification from ``benchpark/repo``.
