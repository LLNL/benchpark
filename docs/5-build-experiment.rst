=======================
Building the experiment
=======================

``benchpark setup`` has set up the directory structure for your experiment.
The next step is setting up the Ramble workspace and building the code::

   cd <experiments_root>/<Benchmark/ProgrammingModel>/<System>/workspace
   ramble --disable-progress-bar --workspace-dir . workspace setup


Ramble will build the source code and set up the following workspace directory structure::

    experiments_root/
        ramble/
        spack/
        <Benchmark/ProgrammingModel>/
            <System>/
                workspace/
                    configs/
                        (everything from source/configs/<System>)
                        (everything from source/experiments/<Benchmark/ProgrammingModel>)
                    experiments/
                        <Benchmark>/
                           <Problem>/
                              <Benchmark>_<ProgrammingModel>_<Problem>
                                    execute_experiment
