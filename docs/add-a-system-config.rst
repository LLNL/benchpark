=============================
Adding a System Configuration
=============================

``benchpark/configs`` contains a directory for each system specified in Benchpark.
If the software stack on your system is unlike the available configurations, 
you can add a new directory with a name which identifies the system.

The following is required for each given system ``benchpark/configs/${SYSTEM}``:

1. ``spack.yaml`` defines default compiler and package names Spack should
use to build the benchmarks on this system.  ``spack.yaml`` becomes the
spack section in the `Ramble configuration file 
<https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/ramble/configuration_files.html#spack-config>`_.

.. code-block:: yaml

    spack:
      packages:
        default-compiler:
          spack_spec: 'spack_spec_for_package'
        default-mpi:
          spack_spec: 'spack_spec_for_package'

2. ``variables.yaml`` defines system-specific launcher and job scheduler.

.. code-block:: yaml

    variables:
      mpi_command: 'mpirun -N {n_nodes} -n {n_ranks}'
      batch_submit: '{execute_experiment}'
      batch_nodes: ''
      batch_ranks: ''
      batch_timeout: ''

3. Optionally, one can add more information about the software installed on the system 
by adding Spack config files in ``benchpark/configs/${SYSTEM}/auxiliary_software_files/``.

- `compilers.yaml <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#compiler-config>`_ defines the compilers installed on the system.
- `packages.yaml <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#package-settings-packages-yaml>`_ defines the pre-installed packages  (e.g., system MPI) on the system.
