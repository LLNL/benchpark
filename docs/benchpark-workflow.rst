Benchpark Workflow
=================================

Follow the workflow diagram to determine if you can run existing configurations or if you will need to add or edit any Benchpark files.

A. Run Existing Systems, Benchmarks and Experiments
----------------------------------------------------

If you are running on an existing ``system``, and the ``benchmark``
and ``experiment`` are already configured, you can proceed directly to the Guided Steps, 
starting with :doc:`benchpark-setup` for:

* Setup / Run / Analyze

B. System Specification
------------------------
A system specification defines the hardware, scheduling system, compilers, and any external libraries that might exist on a system. 

If you are running on a new system that has not been defined in Benchpark yet, proceed to :doc:`add-a-system-config` for the following:

* Find a similar ``system``

* Add or edit a ``system``


C. Benchmark Specification
---------------------------
A benchmark specification defines the application build and run behavior, utilizing spack for build and dependency management.

If you are creating a new benchmark that has not been defined in Benchpark yet, proceed to :doc:`add-a-benchmark` for the following: 

* Add a ``benchmark``


D. Experiment Specification
----------------------------
An experiment specification defines application parameters for experiments that require one or more application runs, such as single-node, scaling, or throughput runs.

If you are adding experiments to a new or existing benchmark, proceed to  :doc:`add-an-experiment` for the following: 

* Add/edit an ``experiment``
